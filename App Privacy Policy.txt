Last Updated: May 6, 2025
This privacy policy applies to the BANTUWORLD app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by neoBOTS (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
1. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE
The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:

The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained and used as described in this privacy policy.
2. LOCATION INFORMATION
The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of it in the following ways:

3. CAMERA AND AUGMENTED REALITY DATA
As an augmented reality application, BANTUWORLD requires access to your device's camera and various sensors to function properly. The camera feed is processed in real-time on your device to identify surfaces and place virtual objects. The Service Provider does not store or transmit the raw camera feed to their servers. Object detection and surface mapping data may be processed on-device to improve the AR experience.
4. THIRD-PARTY ACCESS
Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.
